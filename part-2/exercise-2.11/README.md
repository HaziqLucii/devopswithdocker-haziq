First I git clone from my repo (this is my old project that I did when I'm doing my University assignment) : https://github.com/HaziqLucii/e-counseling

Then I do some tweak by adding some files which I will provide in this folder, which is :

- .env
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yaml
- requirements.txt

Also I changed the db from sqlite3 to mysql in settings.py

then I just run docker compose up -d and it successfully ran
